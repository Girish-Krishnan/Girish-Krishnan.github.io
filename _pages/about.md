Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of control theory, optimization, machine learning and the application of these fields to robotics. I finished a Bachelor of Science at the University of California, San Diego, and triple-majored in the following:

* Electrical Engineering, with a depth in Machine Learning and Controls
* Mathematics-Computer Science
* Physics, with a specialization in Computational Physics

If you are interested in my work, feel free to reach out to me!
