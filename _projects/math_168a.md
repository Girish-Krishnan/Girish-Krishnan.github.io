This course covers random walks on unweighted and weighted graphs (both finite and only locally finite), hitting times, cover times, and recurrent and transient random walks. Some material overlaps with MATH 180C, but 168A treats it from a more applied and discrete perspective and relates it to electrical networks. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments and providing feedback.
