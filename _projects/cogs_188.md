This course gives students a basic understanding of reinforcement learning and AI algorithms. Some of the algorithms discussed include: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Bidirectional Search, A* Search, Simulated Annealing, Dynamic Programming, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Monte Carlo Methods, SARSA, Q-Learning, and Eligibility Traces. I designed many of the programming assignments for this course, which include implementing these algorithms in Python and using them to solve real-world problems. The course ends in a final project where students come up with their own problem and experiment with different algorithms on datasets of their choice.

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Girish-Krishnan/AI-Algorithms/tree/main) contains all the programming assignments that were created for this course.
