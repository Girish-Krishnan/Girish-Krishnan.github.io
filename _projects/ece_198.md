This course is a directed group study where students in the ECE department volunteer to teach high school students about electrical engineering and computer science. The course is run by the UCSD chapter of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), the electrical engineering and computer science honor society, but I was the lead for the course. The students taking this course will learn how to effectively design and teach engineering concepts to high school students to make them engaging and fun! When I conducted the course, we taught high school students about the basics of digital logic design, Arduino programming, and signal processing. 

The course syllabus can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bipWMYUGEZ5DlLSWfPi3TirqoU_ZeTg-2A5SeAzNB_Q/edit?usp=sharing). Note that this is when I conducted the course, and the syllabus may have changed since then.
