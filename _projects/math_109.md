This course uses a variety of topics in mathematics to introduce the students to rigorous mathematical proof, emphasizing quantifiers, induction, negation, proof by contradiction, naive set theory, equivalence relations, and epsilon-delta proofs. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments and providing feedback.
