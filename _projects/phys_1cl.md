Instructor: Jessica Arlett

Quarters: Spring 2024

This is the third quarter of a three-quarter introductory physics course geared toward life-science majors. The physics of oscillations and waves, vibrating strings and sound, and the interaction of light with matter as illustrated through optics and quantum mechanics. I was responsible for grading the students' lab reports and providing feedback.
