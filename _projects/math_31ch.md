This course is an honors version of the standard vector calculus course (MATH 20E). Topics for the course include change of variables formula, integration of differential forms, exterior derivative, generalized Stokeâ€™s theorem, conservative vector fields, potentials. The course is more proof-based than the standard vector calculus course, and students are expected to write proofs for the homework assignments. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments and providing feedback.
