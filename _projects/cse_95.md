This course is taken by students who are first-time tutors in the CSE department. The course covers topics such as how to effectively tutor students, how to grade assignments, how to provide feedback, and how to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for students. The class sessions consist of fun and interesting discussions about the best tutoring practices, while the course assignments encourage students to reflect on their tutoring experiences and learn from them. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments, providing feedback, and facilitating discussions during the class sessions.
