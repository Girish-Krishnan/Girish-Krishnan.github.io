This course introduces students to the basics of engineering research and is taken by students who are participating in the [Guided Engineering Apprenticeship for Research](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/idea/current-undergraduates/gear) (GEAR) program. This is a competitive research program where UCSD students work with a faculty mentor on a research project. The course covers topics such as how to read and write research papers, how to conduct a literature review, how to write a research proposal, how to design experiments, and how to present research findings. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments, providing feedback, and conducting office hours.
