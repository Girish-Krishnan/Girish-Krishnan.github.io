ECE 140A-B blends product design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Students learn about what makes a successful product, including the importance of understanding the customer, the market, the competition, and financials. Simultaneously, students learn the basics of full-stack development and IoT.

In ECE 140A, students learn the basics of full-stack development using FastAPI and MySQL, while using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Students are also exposed to session management, authentication, and authorization. Students also get some exposure to IoT by interfacing an ESP32 microcontroller with a web application. The course ends in a final project where students come up with their own idea for a product and present an MVP proposal.

ECE 140B is a senior capstone project where students work in teams to develop an IoT product. To prepare for this, 140B has a few labs where students learn how to interface Raspberry Pis with sensors, use MQTT to communicate between devices, and even program drones! The course ends in a final project where students present their IoT product to a panel of judges. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments, providing feedback, and helping them with their projects.
