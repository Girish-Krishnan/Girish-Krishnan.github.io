This course introduces students to the basics of entrepreneurship, particularly in the context of tech startups (as most students are computer science and engineering majors). The course lectures cover topics such as idea generation, customer discovery, market research, business models, intellectual property, funding, and pitching. The students work in teams to develop a tech startup idea, perform customer discovery, create a business model, a business plan, and a pitch deck. The course ends in a final presentation where students pitch their startup idea to a panel of judges. I was responsible for grading the students' assignments, providing feedback, and helping them with their projects.
