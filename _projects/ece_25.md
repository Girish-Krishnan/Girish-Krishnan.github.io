This class teaches students the basics of digital logic design including topics such as Boolean algebra, combination and sequential logic, gates and their implementation in digital circuits, finite state machines, and some basic computer architecture. I mainly conducted the lab sessions, where students used the Xilinx Vivado software and Verilog to design and implement digital circuits on an Basys3 board. Through a series of labs, the students built a simple calculator, where if you input two numbers on a TV remote, the calculator would perform the operation and display the result on a 7-segment display on the Basys3 board. I was responsible for grading the students' lab reports, providing feedback, and helping them with their labs.
